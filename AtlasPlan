one parent layer that includes:
1-Readme file explaining site content, organisation, presentation and methods;
2-Main shapefile with effort data per cell;
3-Pdf of all density maps w/short text explaining what it is and methods (EN + FR);
3.2-Effort map (or added to the atlas pdf);
3.3-Graph of presence calendar per guild/species (or added to the atlas pdf below);
4- copy of field protocol.

Child layer(s):
zipped folders of:
5- all maps (per season, or all incuded in this zip file?);
6- all density data;
7-species codes + density data metadata;
8- all detection model pdfs;

OR:
zipped files of the child layer directly added to parent layer... sounds like a better idea.
